Horizon
---
Horizon is the client-facing API server for the Triam network ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between [Triam Core](#) and applications that want to access the Triam network. Horizon allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, and subscribe to event streams.

You can interact directly with Horizon via cURL or a web browser. Triam network also provides a [JavaScript SDK](docs/overview#overview) for clients to use to interact with Horizon.

Triam network runs an [instance of Horizon](https://testnet-horizon.triamnetwork.com/) that is connected to the testnet.

## Libraries

Libraries maintained and forked from Triam network :<br />
